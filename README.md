1. The pipeline is the NowcastingEco.py file. It allows to:
- clean the headlines data from the media
- filter and analyze the tones of articles for a specific theme and country + compare it to a reference indicator

2. To run this, you can use the run_pipeline.ipynb file.

In this repository, you can also find independant analysis such as:
- Correlations between sub-components of the GDP and the GDP itself
- Study of the seasonality of each of theses indicators
- Training and testing of NLP models in order to better estimate the tone of our news data
